    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
\end{center}

I am deeply grateful for the advice and support from my research advisor, Professor Everett Shock, as well as from my advisory committee members Professors Hilairy Hartnett and Pierre Herckes.

I also extend thanks to Roger Summons of MIT for graciously allowing the use of his laboratory and HPLC-MS instrumentation. I thank Emily Matys for her assistance while running calibration curves. Thank you to Xiaolei Liu for volunteering to re-run a batch of lipid samples.

Florence Schubotz of MARUM, University of Bremen, was instrumental in providing analytical instruction, preparing authentic standards, and imparting helpful advice countless times. She was a source of great inspiration to me and set me down the path of lipidomics.

I thank Jeff Dick of Central South University for introducing me to coding in the R programming language. The R package he developed, CHNOSZ, was incredibly helpful for performing many of the thermodynamic calculations described in this dissertation.

I am grateful for having had the chance to work with members of the Group Exploring Organic Processes in Geochemistry (GEOPIG), who include, but are not limited to, Alta Howells, Apar Prasad, Brian St. Claire, James Leong, Jenna Donatelli, Kirt Robinson, Kris Fecteau, Kristin Johnson, Panjai Prapaipong, Michelle Santana, Tucker Ely, and Vince Debes. I also thank Natalya Zolotova for her help generating water chemistry data. Jade Woods deserves special thanks for the hours she spent assisting me with lipid extractions. It was a pleasure to work with all of these years.

Thank you to my parents, Lisa and Clayton Boyer, as well as my wife Angela for their love and support. I am incredibly lucky to have you as my family.

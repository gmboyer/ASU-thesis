    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
\end{center}

I am deeply grateful for the advice and support from my research advisor, Professor Everett Shock, as well as from my advisory committee members Professors Hilairy Hartnett and Pierre Herckes.

I also extend thanks to Roger Summons of MIT for graciously allowing the use of his laboratory and HPLC-MS instrumentation. I thank Emily Matys for her assistance while running calibration curves. Thank you to Xiaolei Liu for volunteering to re-run a batch of lipid samples.

Florence Schubotz of MARUM, University of Bremen, was instrumental in providing analytical instruction, preparing authentic standards, and imparting helpful advice countless times. She was a source of great inspiration to me and set me down the path of lipidomics.

I thank Jeff Dick of Central South University for introducing me to coding in the R programming language. The R package he developed, CHNOSZ, was incredibly helpful for performing many of the thermodynamic calculations described in this dissertation.

I am grateful for having the chance to work with members of the Group Exploring Organic Processes in Geochemistry (GEOPIG), who include, but are not limited to, Alta Howells, Apar Prasad, Brian St. Claire, James Leong, Jenna Donatelli, Kirt Robinson, Kris Fecteau, Kristin Johnson, Panjai Prapaipong, Michelle Santana, Tucker Ely, and Vince Debes. I also thank Natalya Zolotova for her help generating water chemistry data. Jade Woods deserves a special thanks for the hours she spent assisting me with lipid extractions. It was a pleasure to work with all of these years.

Thank you to my parents, Lisa and Clayton Boyer, as well as my wife Angela for their love and support. I am incredibly lucky to have you as my family.

% Jenna Donatelli performed temperature, pH, and conductivity measurements, kept cartography records of the hot springs we visited, and lifted spirits with her upbeat attitude. Apar Prasad, Carlos Castellanos, and Kristin Johnson performed field spectrophotometry on water samples. As one of the few members of GEOPIG with an interest in thermodynamic calculations involving biomolecules, Apar has been a sort of kindred spirit, and as such I have valued his feedback regarding thermodynamic calculations involving lipids. Carlos Castellanos performed quality work during the 2011 and 2012 field seasons and I had a great time jamming out to music with him on our Yellowstone trips. Kristin Johnson and I joined GEOPIG at the same time, shared an interview with Everett Shock during graduate school visitation at the same time, and since then I have considered Kristin a close friend; I have fond memories of exploring Tokyo, camping in Greer, Arizona, and trying out new board games with Kristin. Kris Fecteau managed, coordinated, and troubleshooted ion chromatography, or in other words, did most of the heavy-lifting for the analysis of major dissolved ions. He also plays a mean game of chess and absolutely stomped me at it in Yellowstone. Randall "Vince" Debes and Kirt Robinson had a great many responsibilities field and in the laboratory including (but not limited to), collecting water and dissolved gas and preparing samples for analysis of major ions and dissolved organic/inorganic carbon. In addition to the countless additional roles they had in the successful analysis of 2012 water samples, Vince and Kirt have been inspirational friends and colleagues. I value the years of adventures we have had inside and outside of work.

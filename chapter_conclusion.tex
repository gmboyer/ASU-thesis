\chapter[CONCLUSION]{Conclusion}

Lipids must function across the entire set of conditions where life exists. As such, there is an enormous variety of lipid structures in biology representing adaptation to function for their source organism, wherever they live. As was discussed in this dissertation, however, certain structural adaptations in lipids are known to function effectively in very different sets of environmental conditions; \textit{e.g.}, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) can create stable lipid membranes in both thermophiles and mesophiles. Likewise, very different sets of lipid distributions may function effectively in the similar environmental conditions; \textit{e.g.}, GDGTs or non-GDGTs can create stable lipid membranes in mesophiles. Any given lipid adaptation, whether it is a double bond, a longer alkyl chain, or a particular headgroup, will have an energetic cost associated with its biosynthesis, and these costs likely change depending on the temperature, pressure, and chemical context of the surroundings.

This work provided evidence to support the hypothesis that natural selection favors convergence upon lipid compositions that maximize function while also minimizing energetic cost. First, the abundance-weighted Z\textsubscript{C} of lipids sampled from microorganisms from four alkaline hot springs was shown to correlate positively with the oxidation state of the environment, and that adaptations to provide alkyl chain functionality and membrane fluidity were themselves oxidized under oxidized conditions and reduced under reduced conditions, which I hypothesized was energetically cost-efficient. Subsequent thermodynamic analysis supported this hypothesis for intact polar lipid (IPL) alkyl chains by providing evidence that observed IPL distributions were stable relative to each other along redox gradients and correlated positively with environmental Eh. Lipid headgroups were also investigated and yielded similar results to those of alkyl chains; that hot spring Eh was correlated positively with Eh predicted by thermodynamically stable configurations of observed headgroup ratios. In sum, this work suggests structural adaptations in lipid distributions are not only present because they function for their source organisms, but because they are cost-effective to produce within the temperature and geochemical context of their surroundings.

The thermodynamic studies reported in this dissertation did not include calculations involving individual reactions of lipid biosynthesis pathways in their evaluation of lipid cost. Instead, net reactions to form lipids from measured concentrations of bioavailable dissolved solutes in the surrounding water alone provided evidence that observed the biosynthesis of lipid distributions in hot spring microorganisms may be energetically cost-effective. This raises the possibility that conditions \textit{outside} of the cell dictate the energetic cost of lipid biosynthesis more than the conditions \textit{inside} of the cell, and that the external environment is key to understanding patterns in lipid distributions; perhaps moreso than can be revealed by phylogenetic studies of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis.

Future studies of lipid distributions should strive to be as quantitative as possible to allow estimation of weighted molecular properties like the average oxidation state of carbon (Z\textsubscript{C}) or thermodynamic properties that would allow prediction of equilibrium abundances. Furthermore, thermodynamic predictions of lipid abundance are most useful when details about the surrounding geochemistry are measured, such as temperature, pressure, pH, concentrations of dissolved solutes contributing to major water chemistry, possible sources of exogenous organic matter, and so on. This way, trends in abundance-weighted Z\textsubscript{C} may be tested across a variety of environmental conditions to determine if they persist outside the four springs studied in this work.

The next steps of these thermodynamic calculations could involve the formation of lipids from a different set of basis species than the `autotrophic' set used in this work. It may be more appropriate to use acetate, for instance, to predict lipid distributions in a predominantly heterotrophic microbial community. Future studies could focus on reducing sources of error to aid the comparison of thermodynamically predicted and analytically observed lipid abundances. Constraining sources of error introduced by lack of authentic response factors may offer a better estimation of aminopolyol BHP abundance. Alternate estimation schemes could be explored to estimate lipid thermodynamic properties. Liquid-phase or crystalline-phase alkyl chains, or some combination of the two, could be included in formation reactions from aqueous basis species to simulate the formation of a membrane lipid; this may offer a better predictive model than the formation of free aqueous lipids. Alternative methods for predicting complex distributions of lipids from basis species could be explored, and results could be compared to outcomes produced by the hypothetical site-averaged chains.

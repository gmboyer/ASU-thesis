% membrane has to function. Biology has various ways of providing function in all conditions in which life exists, which likely explains why we see enormous variety in lip structures. among the possibilities of lipid structures for a given organism and set of env conditions, those that provide the best function for the least cost will likely be selected by evolution.

% ZC of IPL headgroups did not show carbon becoming more oxidized downstream. Is this a fluke? Artifact of the semiquantitative method for obtaining lipid abundance? If trend is real, does it translate to deviation from equilibrium in the context of hot spring redox chemistry, thereby suggesting increased biosynthetic cost? What does ZC of BHP headgroups say? How do ZC trends compare to thermodynamically-predicted relative abundances of BHP headgroups behave along a redox gradient? Is ZC predictive of behavior, or is something else going on? Addressed by thermo predictions.
